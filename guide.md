```YAML

layout: manual
tag: manual

So first navigate to the GitHub Repository, click "Add file" and then name the file `[YourNameHere].md`. Copy the above codeblock in to the file.

Edit `title: Joe Blogs` to reflect your name

If you wish to include a photo, paste in a link to a publicly accessible photo of yourself 
```yaml
