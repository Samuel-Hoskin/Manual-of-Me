You will need a [GitHub](https://github.com) Account to add your own manual. If you do not have a account you can [sign up](https://github.com/signup) for one. Follow GitHub's [Sign Up Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account#signing-up-for-a-new-account) if you are unsure how.

Once logged in, navigate to the site's [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Samuel-Hoskin/Manual-of-Me), click "Add file" and then name the file `[YourNameHere].md`(Note: No spaces within the file name). Copy the above codeblock in to the file.

Edit `title: Joe Blogs` to reflect your name

If you wish to include a photo, paste in a link to a publicly accessible photo of yourself. If not you can leave this blank
```yaml
photo:
  - link: [Your Photo Link here (Inc https://)]
    alt: [text describing the image for those using screen readers] 
```
For each of the questions, you can choose whether to answer and include it in your manual. Lets take `# How I learn best`. For each bullet point answer you want to give, enter, tab and dash. You should end up with something looking like the below
```yaml
# How I learn best
Learn:
    - [Bullet Point 1]
    - [Bullet Point 2]
    - [Bullet Point 3]

```

[GIF Advice]
```yaml
# If I were an animated gif/meme, I would be...
Gif:
  - link: 
    alt: 
```

Once you are happy with your answers, click `Propose New File`. Then on the next page click `Create Pull Request` then click on it again. 

If you are unsure what a pull request is, simply put it is a proposal to upload your changes to the repo and there for this site. If you want to learn more about pull requests and git [... you can find out more here etc ]
