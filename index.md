## What is a Manual of Me?

A "Manual of Me" is a guide or document that outlines an individual's personal approach to life and work. It is a tool for self-discovery and self-awareness that can help individuals identify their values, beliefs, goals, and priorities, and provide guidance on how to live and work in alignment with these principles.

## What makes up a Manual of Me?

The contents of a Manual of Me will vary depending on the individual. This tool currently has 10 questions built in based of [Atlassian's Template](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/my-user-manual):

 - Times / hours I like to work
 - Best ways to communicate with me
 - How I best receive feedback
 - Things I need
 - How I learn best
 - Things I struggle with
 - Things I love
 - Other things to know about me

This is open-source site, so if you feel there should be more built in ones, please contribute.

This site can also accommodate individual questions for each manual.
